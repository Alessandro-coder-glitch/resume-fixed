<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Alex. 
  I am a 19-year-old in love with everything that involves the digital world. Learning how it works!
  Presently, I am a computer engineering undergraduate, where I get to interact in the world of coding and emerging technologies.
  In addition to that, I am currently doing a course in web development which enables me to blend my artistic side with technical know-how to build great websites.
 Learning is my passion, therefore, I am always on the lookout for engaging projects where I can implement everything that I have been taught. 
 During my free time, I like tinkering with new technologies, gaming and exchanging ideas with my friends. 
 
 Thank you for taking the time to view my profile!
